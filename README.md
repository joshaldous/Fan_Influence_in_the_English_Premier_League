# Do You Influence Your Team's Chance of Winning?

## Overview

In the world of professional soccer a players ability to read and react to the game is everything.  If you are the first to the ball, you control the situation, thereby giving your team the advantage in this moment.  As you sit in the stands watching your team battle it out against a hated rival, a loose ball rolls to an open spot on the field directly in between one of your players and one of their's.  As they sprint to the ball, your team gets there first and toes the ball past an out-of-contol opponent who crashes into your player.  A split-second before contact occurs, you and 60,000 of your commrades howl for blood.  The referee obliges and shows their player a red card, giving your team a massive advantage for the rest of the game.  

A few seconds later, you reflect on the tackle.  It really wasn't that bad.  It was a bit dodgy, but it may not have been enough to reduce them to 10-men.  Was it the crowd?  Did the roar of the fans pressure the ref to make a game-altering decision?  I wanted to find out if the number of cards (yellow and red) shown to players away from home has historically been significantly more than we would expect.

In soccer players who commited fouls cede a free kick to the opposing team at the position where the foul occurred.  If the ref deems a certain foul to be sufficiently reckless, the ref will show the player a yellow card.  This is akin to a technical foul in basketball.  If that player commits a second bookable offense, they are shown a second yellow and ejected from the game without replacement (i.e. two yellow cards equals one red).  If a foul is dangerous to the opposing player, that play can be shown a straight red card and ejected from the game without replacement.  

## Questions
  1. Are referees significantly more likely to show red and yellow cards to away players?
  2. Are referees significantly more likely to show red and yellow cards to players on smaller clubs, regardless of whether they are home or away?
  3. 

## EDA


## Visualization

Judging the word 'significantly' in my questions above is a bit tricky.  As a general formula, home teams tend to attack and be on the front foot more, while away teams try to keep an organized, defensive shape and patiently wait for oppurtunities to score.  At least that is how it was for most of the 20th century.  That formula is shifting to more of one where certain teams play certain ways regardless of where the match is held.  So, straight away I wanted to see if the number of cards given to home teams was about equal to the number of cards given to away teams as a starting point.
